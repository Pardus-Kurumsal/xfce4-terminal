xfce4-terminal (0.6.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  Starting with 0.6, xfce4-terminal doesn't support anymore setting
  keybindings in the preferences, but support it using GTK accelerators.

  If you want to edit them, you need to enable that features. Under Xfce you
  do that using the appearance settings (xfce4-appearance-settings), last tab
  (Settings), where you tick the “Enable editable accelerators” checkbox.

  Then, in xfce4-terminal, you can select a menu entry, then press the
  relevant key to bind it directly, or press backspace to delete the
  accelerator.
